The study of calorimetry involves measuring the amount of heat released or absorbed during chemical reactions, physical changes, or phase transitions. In the context of food science, calorimetry is crucial for determining the caloric content of food items. Traditional methods of calorimetric analysis can be time consuming and require significant manual intervention. The integration of image processing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies offers a novel approach to automate and enhance the accuracy of calorimetric measurements in food. Objective: This project aims to develop a system that utilizes image processing and IoT to measure the caloric content of burned food samples efficiently and accurately. The system is designed to automate the data collection process, enhance the precision of measurements, and provide real-time monitoring and analysis. Keywords: Machine Learning, Open CV ,Image Processing, IoT Integration, Data Analysis.
